MSC Cruises aims to become a top-three global cruise line but faces challenges like low brand differentiation, price sensitivity, and limited presence in the luxury market. Our case study explores a dual-segmentation strategy, introducing premium cruise offerings while maintaining affordability in the mid-range segment. We recommend value-based pricing, digital marketing, and expansion into the U.S. market to strengthen brand perception and drive revenue. By implementing these strategies, MSC can enhance customer loyalty, capture new markets, and sustain long-term growth in the competitive cruise industry.
